To deploy this Python script to Azure Functions, you can follow these steps:

Sign in to the Azure portal and create a new Function App.
In your Function App, create a new Python function using the "HTTP trigger" template.
Replace the default code in the function with the Python script from the previous answer.
In the function's settings, under the "Configuration" section, add the following application settings:
ENDPOINT: the URL of the endpoint for getting user information
DB_NAME: the name of your PostgreSQL database
DB_USER: the username for accessing your PostgreSQL database
DB_PASSWORD: the password for accessing your PostgreSQL database
Install the requests and psycopg2 modules in your function's Python environment by adding them to the requirements.txt file.
Deploy your function by saving and publishing it.
Once the function is deployed, it will continuously seed your PostgreSQL database with user information from the specified endpoint whenever the function is triggered. You can test the function by making a HTTP request to the function's URL.
